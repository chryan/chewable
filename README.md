# Chewable Framework

Chewable is designed to make your life easier for game development. It is a C++ component-based framework that aims to serve as a solid foundation for getting a game up and running quicker.

It is as minimal as a library can be and does not require any dependencies to compile (uses gtest for unit tests). It does <b>NOT</b> include features for windowing, input, graphics, audio but the framework's design allows these systems to be plugged in easily.

For some of the features mentioned above and others such as level management and data format specific serialization, check the <a href="https://github.com/chryan/delectable">Delectable Engine</a>.

NOTE: This framework was originally hosted on Google Code, and is used by the game <a href="http://www.deity-game.com/">Deity</a>.
